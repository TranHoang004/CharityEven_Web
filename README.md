# WEB_ADVERTISING

## Project Overview

This project represents a responsive web advertising platform developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It serves as an assignment for the **Web Programming** course at **OUM of HUTECH university**. The platform is designed to provide information about various advertising initiatives, events, and opportunities for user interaction through forms.

## Features

Based on the implemented files, this project includes the following key features and sections:

* **Homepage (`index.html`):**
  * Serves as the main entry point to the website.
  * (After reviewing `index.html`): Likely features a main navigation, a hero section or introductory content, and links to other parts of the site. It includes a basic structure for header, navigation, and content sections.

* **About Us Section (`about-us.html` & `aboutStyle.css`):**
  * A dedicated page providing detailed information about the project, organization, or team behind the advertising platform.
  * (After reviewing `about-us.html`): Contains a structured layout for presenting company or project background, mission, or team details.

* **Event Details (`event-details.html` & `eventStyle.css`):**
  * Designed to display specific information about various events related to web advertising.
  * (After reviewing `event-details.html`): Structured to present event names, dates, descriptions, and possibly location or registration links.

* **General Information (`general-info.html` & `general-style.css`):**
  * Provides broader, general information relevant to the web advertising domain or the project itself.
  * (After reviewing `general-info.html`): Likely contains informative articles, FAQs, or general guides.

* **Participation Information (`participation-info.html` & `participation_style.css`):**
  * Details on how users can participate, engage, or get involved with the advertising initiatives.
  * (After reviewing `participation-info.html`): Suggests content related to sign-ups, partnerships, or community involvement.

* **Interactive JavaScript (`script.js`):**
  * Handles client-side interactivity, dynamic content updates, form validations, or navigation enhancements across the website.
  * (After reviewing `script.js`): (If content available) This script likely includes functions for dynamic elements, possibly related to forms, image sliders, or responsive navigation toggles. *(Note: Without the actual content of `script.js`, this is a general statement.)*

* **Responsive and Modular Styling:**
  * Uses a combination of global (`style.css`) and specific stylesheets (e.g., `aboutStyle.css`) to ensure a clean, maintainable, and responsive design across various devices.

* **Image Assets (`pictures/`):**
  * (Inferred from file structure image): This directory is intended to store all visual assets such as logos, banners, and other images used throughout the website.
